### Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Dates are displayed in UTC.

#### 0.1.2

> 10 October 2026

- The codex file names the node by its full type, `@dentalrx/n8n-nodes-appwrite.appwrite`, as n8n's verification review asked [`#19`](https://github.com/DentalRx/n8n-nodes-appwrite-api/pull/19).
- The repository moved to [DentalRx/n8n-nodes-appwrite-api](https://github.com/DentalRx/n8n-nodes-appwrite-api). The npm package name is unchanged.

#### 0.1.1

> 26 September 2026

Fixes from running every operation against Appwrite Cloud [`#17`](https://github.com/DentalRx/n8n-nodes-appwrite-api/pull/17):

- Health › Get Certificate: Domain is now a required field. Appwrite refuses the request without it, so the default configuration always failed. A 0.1.0 workflow that set Domain under Options needs it entered again.
- Webhook › Create and Update: blank HTTP username and password are left out. Appwrite refuses empty credentials, so updating any webhook without basic authentication failed.
- OAuth2 server errors now show Appwrite's reason (`error_description`) instead of "Request failed with status code 400".
- A request that is safe to repeat (GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE) is sent once more when the connection is reset before Appwrite answers. The live runs hit such resets on about one request in a hundred. Creates and other POST or PATCH requests are never repeated.
